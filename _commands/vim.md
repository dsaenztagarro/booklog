- `vert sfind myfile.c`

- `<C-R>a` paste content of register a (Insert mode)

- `:silent grep WORD | copen`:
  * ":silent" will also avoid the hit-enter prompt
  * grep populates quickfix list (`copen`)

- `:nnoremap <buffer> <leader>x dd`. The `<buffer>` in the second `nnoremap`
  command told Vim to only consider that mapping when we're in the buffer where
  we defined it.

- `3fn` search for the third `n` in the line

{% highlight bash %}
:args `git grep -l findme`

- Vim has bufdo, windo, tabdo and argdo
